Upgrade to [Extended WPF Toolkit Plus](http://xceed.com/Extended_WPF_Toolkit_Intro.html?adtype=150) to get a year's worth of priority support, extra controls, extra features, early access to updates, and more. All for only $349.95.

Not only will you get more features and great support, but you'll **support the project**. You'll help ensure Xceed can continue to release great updates with new controls, features, and tons of fixes and improvements many times a year. Currently we have two full-time developers that are exclusively working on Extended WPF Toolkit, and as many .NET/WPF technical support engineers as needed to ensure all priority support questions are answered. We can only do this with your support.
